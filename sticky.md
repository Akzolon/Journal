## On the motive:

Before you can create art that other people enjoy, you must first be the kind of person who can create meaningful art. 

But to create meaningful art, you must love the work itself.

Your own work, not any possible result from it. 

Be happy if others who see your art find enjoyment in it, but that mustn't be the motive of your work, nor your reason, nor your reward! 


## On When to leave:

If you find no joy in the laborious task of making art in a specific field, leave it.

There is no point in struggling for something you don't want. 

It would be a waste of time by definition.

If something intrinsic, deep and personal called you to venture in that field, don't worry, it will call for you again.
