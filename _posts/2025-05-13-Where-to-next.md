I've have decided

I know what I want


So:

I cannot animate if I don't have a storyboard
I cannot make a storyboard If I don't have the audio made
I cannot make the audio If I don't have the story


so

I OUGHT TO MAKE A STORY

and while I'm making a story of my short object short film why shouldn't I dig out that long dead story I started working on the 6th of November in the distant past of 2023? I worked only when I was too bored with other stuff... I finished the [Vomit draft](https://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/qwf3ls/what_is_a_vomit_draft/) on the 1st of January 2025.

Yeah... a year and a half for a beat sheet, story outline and a vomit draft... oof


Ok but let's be more specific:


I will start working on fixing the story of THE MINE 

and

I will go back to looking for mistakes in the Vomit draft of "Sunless Lands" (I have been putting that off for way too long)
