# The Good news

I have finished lip syncing Fossil and I have moved on to Perdue (The French hat)

Even though I had the whole day free, I only lip synced the first line.

Fr:

En:

I guess that's an accurate representation of my sleep.


Since every mouth is hand drawn I drew a floating mouth next to Perdue to use as a reference for colour.

It's helpful. Adobe Animate can be weird at times.

# The Bad news

I am unnaturally tired
and I hate it...

I hate having Springtime lethargy 
Most specifically It's symptoms

I am ***much*** more tired. 
However I can still think... and 

I'm not as productive in my personal labours as I COULD HAVE BEEN if I were not dead tired.
I'm unhappy because I can't really do the things I enjoy doing. 

Today I have slept during the day for 3 hours straight.
I never sleep during the day.
Fever dreams are always fun.

I'm still doing my obligated labours since I don't have much of a choice.
I hope this ends soon.
