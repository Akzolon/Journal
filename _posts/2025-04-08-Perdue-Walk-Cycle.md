Usually I hate animating walk cycles because they're just so annoying to do.

But for the newest Animation that I've been working on I have to Animate a walk cycle.

So I decided to experiment a little.

I've found this Guide by a famous Animator [Richard Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Williams_(animator)) and decided to follow it.

Animation for Object show doesn't usually take long so I can permit myself some room for experimentation.

You can see the result at the top of this page in the .gif format.

To be honest, It turned out way better than I have expected and I'm glad that it did. 

My previous way of animating walk cycles was terrible and I desperately needed a new method.

Because the method I used while animating [The Magician](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4l25xpmrhc) doesn't really work when animating objects.
