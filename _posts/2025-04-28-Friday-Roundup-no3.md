I never was into stickman fighting animations as a kid. I don't know, I never discovered Newgrounds until very late. The exception would be [The AVA Series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7z8SQeih5AfL0gwMqD80TwO79TvosRHR) but AVA isn't *REALLY* about fighting. 

But recently I rediscovered a cool little game called [YOMI Hustle](https://ivysly.itch.io/your-only-move-is-hustle)

That game is full on stickman fights. 


And yeah It's fun.
