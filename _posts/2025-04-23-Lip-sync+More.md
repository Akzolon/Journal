Ugh yeah
I'm okay

# Old news first


I finished Lip Syncing Perdue

:D

Here's the final result:

It looks much better than I hoped it would and for that I'm happy


I like this more realistic style of lip sync where the mouth moves less violently.

I think I should use it more, I don't know. It just looks better to me.


I'm finally done with lip syncing :)

Even though I usually hate lip syncing I think I've discovered a lot of good techniques that actually make lip syncing less boring. I guess its only tiring to do something you want when you lack skills in that area. 

These techniques will very likely come in handy in the future


All that's left to animate now is the body movements 



# New news next

I got back into Music making

BLEGH,
it was a mess...
but I made full song

Full 57 seconds long

This morning I also started making a song... and, eh... 

I'm still not sure if that's something I want to pursue on the same level as I am doing rn to animation...

Even though I enjoyed it, I think I could've spent my time better. Maybe drawing, maybe writing... 

I don't know
