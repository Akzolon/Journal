I don't have much time so I shall be quick.


11/30 pages analysed


and I've restructured the whole system


Story 
└── Plot 
    └── Arc
        └── Sequence
            └── Scene 
                └── Event
                    └── Beat 
                        └── Moment 


I'm mostly working on the BEAT level

4 different types of beats I'm differentiating

| **Symbols** | **NAME**                  | **Abbreviation** (W.I.P.) |
| ----------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| ABC         | Complete Beat             | CB                        |
| ?BC         | Unfounded Beat            | UFB                       |
| A?C         | Unprovoked Beat           | UPB                       |
| AB?         | Unanswered Beat           | UAB                       |
| ↑BC         | Connected Complete Beat   | CCB                       |
| ↑?C         | Connected Unprovoked Beat | CUPB                      |
| ↑B?         | Connected Unanswered Beat | CUAB                      |


I've also differentiated 3 different types of scenes

| **Symbols** | **NAME**                 | **Abbreviation** (W.I.P.) |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| 123         | Complete Event Scene     | CES                       |
| 1x23        | Unadressed Event Scene   | UAES                      |
| 12x3        | Unconfronted Event Scene | UCES                      |

Some food for brain



Story (Everything in total)
└── Plot (??????)
    └── Arc (??????)
        └── Sequence (Multiple 123s)
            └── Scene (123)
                └── Event (Multiple ABCs)
                    └── Beat (ABC)
                        └── Moment (Irreducible)



I still haven't figures out how to systematise Arcs


Not sure if it would even be helpful

could any differentiation other than GOOD and BAD story arch even be made?

or are they too MARCO to be meaningfully categorised
