Today... I've spent all my leuisre time playing video games

And it didn't bring me any joy

It wasn't really fun, more like tiring... 
and I really miss drawing and animating

Both of those things are similar and are in essence only different flavours of problem-solving. 


Even though animation is more difficult, I'd say it's also far more rewarding and thus more enjoyable. It requires much more focus on the task at hand but also gives much greater a reward. A knowledge of one's own achievement and a creation unique to the whole of existance. 


Something Videogames cannot ever offer. 




Don't starve and YOMI Hustle are still good games though
