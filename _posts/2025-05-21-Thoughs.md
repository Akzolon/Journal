UGRHHHHHHHHHHH

I'm a problem solver

not a system analyst


But to fix the problems of my story I must dissect it first.

I have invented myself a method for that that works, but still... the task itself is VERY repetitive.

I regularly drift off or find myself thinking "How should I fix this scene" which is not what I should be doing right now.

What I'm currently doing is not problem solving and that's what is draining my will to go on. I'm currently analysing and dissecting EVERY SINGLE BEAT in the bloody story. This WILL be tremendously useful later on when I go to problem-solve.

But right now it's driving me mad...

It is as if my method of thinking is wired against this kind of repetitive behaviour.
