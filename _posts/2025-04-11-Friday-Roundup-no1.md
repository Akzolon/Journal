NOTE:

So, I usually don't do any Animation/Drawing/Directing on Fridays for personal reasons.

No, I'm not a Muslim, I'm just more tired on Friday than I am on any other day. 

I usually don't do anything productive during my free time on Fridays.

Not really sure why

`¯\_(ツ)_/¯

So Immna do a Roundup!
