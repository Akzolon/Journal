I'm glad to see something I made. It is my no means perfect, but it is something I made. 


So the original plan for the animation was just to make Fossil and Perdue sing [Amour Plastique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_IKqQ9-4OU) together, but then I found a REALLY good tutorial on VHS Style and I had to try it out. 

I didn't apply all the effects that were shown in the video. Adobe After Effects is an odd animal. 

But all in all. I'm very happy with the result.


Now the real question is....

## Where to next?



So I've had a few thing planned:

1) Working on THE MINE (a short object film set in space, based on my old OSC short film from 2023)

2) Animating [ANDREW RYAN's SPEECH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnEDJ6tGr3s) (A funny thing on which I could practice facial expressions and body movement)

3) Animating Crownster singing [Rolling down to old Maui](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCKJM2juNhk) (I could practice facial expressions and body movement here too)




Looking at it now....


THE MINE 

It will take a lot of time because I would need to drastically re-write the whole plot, animate all scenes and find one (or two) Voice actors who will be willing to voice for free.

It would also be my first actual object film

That would be interesting


ANDREW RYAN's SPEECH 

Eh... Not really fond of doing that ANDREW RYAN thing... I still haven't finished Bioshock. It would however be interesting to try to animate a speech from a low camera angle. That's how I imagine that speech being held. It would be problem solving issue. I have NO CLUE how I would actually handle that.

That would be interesting


CROWNSTER SINGING

Crownster is an OLD object oc of mine. I have animated him singing THAT specific song before, but it was in May 2023 and the video lasts 2 seconds. It could be useful in figuring out how much I've improved, but do I really need to EXPLICITY see that? I have my old animations still saved. Horrible as they are my new animation are much better than those ones and I know that. The most I could do is to animate some wild poses but that would be mostly it. It would again be "a character on a stage singing"

That doesn't really sound interesting.
